# GameConsoleMode (GCM) üéÆ

**GameConsoleMode** (GCM) is a powerful C# application built with **WinUI 3**, designed to transform your PC into a fully functional gaming console while retaining the flexibility of the Windows operating system. GCM temporarily replaces the Windows shell with a custom gaming environment, providing a seamless console-like experience.

Whether you're a Steam enthusiast, a Playnite user, or prefer your own custom launcher, GCM offers a streamlined gaming experience without unnecessary Windows distractions.

Something like **SteamOS**, but powered by the **Windows engine**.
